# Car-Sales-KPI-Forecast
This project predicts the next 3 months’ values for car dealership KPIs (like sales, profit, and other financial metrics) using historical monthly data. It includes an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize trends, seasonality, and KPI correlations, and allows users to test “what-if” scenarios to see how changing one KPI affects others.
Project Title – Car Sales & KPI Forecast Dashboard

Problem Statement – The dealership wants a system that can predict car sales and other important numbers (KPIs) for the next 3 months using old sales data. This will help them plan their budget better. The system should also show how these numbers are connected to each other, for example, how profit changes if the number of cars sold changes.

How to Use – Steps to open PBIX, see charts, run Python model if needed.

Predictions – the 3-month forecast CSV was generated.

Interactive Features – What-If parameters, KPI correlations, slicers.

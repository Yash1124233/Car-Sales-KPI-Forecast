# Car-Sales-KPI-Forecast
This project predicts the next 3 months’ values for car dealership KPIs (like sales, profit, and other financial metrics) using historical monthly data. It includes an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize trends, seasonality, and KPI correlations, and allows users to test “what-if” scenarios to see how changing one KPI affects others.
